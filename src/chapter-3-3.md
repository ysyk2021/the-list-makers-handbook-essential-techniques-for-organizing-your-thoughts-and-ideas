For larger or complex tasks, break them down into smaller, manageable subtasks. By doing so, you create a clear roadmap for execution, making it easier to track progress and maintain momentum.

### **6. Set Deadlines**

Assign deadlines to tasks on your lists whenever possible. This helps create a sense of urgency and ensures that important items are completed in a timely manner. Be realistic when setting deadlines to avoid unnecessary pressure.
